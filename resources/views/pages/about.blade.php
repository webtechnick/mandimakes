            <p>Mandi is an artist.  One of her greatest sources of inspiration is the nerd-o-sphere.  As a member of a (perhaps embarrassingly large) number of fandoms, much of her work is created to give tribute to those books, songs, movies, shows, and games which she enjoys most.  Her family can attest to this love of fan art, by simply pointing to any one of her many pieces that adorn her home.</p>

            <p>Beginning with traditional mediums in drawing, Mandi has since branched out into various crafty mediums; her current favorite being polymer clay.  She cheerfully invites you to browse around, have a glimpse at her own nerdy loves, and put in a request if you’re a member of a fandom which isn’t represented within her works; or if -*gasp*- you would prefer something not nerdily inclined.</p>
